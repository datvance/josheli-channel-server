To create a channel:

- php artisan make:channel "My Channel"

- Implement the MyChannel->items() method to return the items
  for the main menu of your channel. Items can be either
  Directories or Tracks.

- You can create individual Directory objects in the Directories
  directory, or you can create methods on your Channel that return
  generic Directory objects. See Christian Science channel for
  example of the former, and NASL Now for example of the latter.

- Create individual representations of audio or video tracks in the
  "Tracks" directory. Again, see Christian Science channel for examples.

- If you need advanced, or dynamic, routing, you can create a routes.php
  file in the top-level of your Channel. It will be namespaced to your
  Channel, your Channel object will be available, and the prefix will
  be "/channel/channel-id/". See Big 12 Sports for an example.
